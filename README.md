# Data-Wrangling-Data-Preparation-in-Python
In this project we convert multiple tsv files into one consolidate excel file with only our desired info by custom defined function

## We are given several tsv (tab separeted values) files like such. Here all info are not in standard column wise format. Rather some info are row wise and rest of the info are standard columnwise.

### tsv file : FBA181B7GSP5.tsv

### tsv file : FBA181BC7LP4.tsv

### tsv file : FBA181BCD5HX.tsv

## From all those tsv files we have to derive this target excel file (Target File.xlsx)
